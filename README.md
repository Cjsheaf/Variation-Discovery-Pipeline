Variation-Discovery-Pipeline
============================
The purpose of this application is to execute a user-defined series of tasks related to molecular modeling and drug screening. The tasks and their dependencies are specified in XML format, and will be run in parallel where dependencies permit. The application is written primarily in Python, but the tasks do not necessarily need to be (they can be scripts in other languages or standalone executables).
